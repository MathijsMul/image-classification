# Bag-of-Words and Convolutional Neural Net image classifiers

Two image classifiers are implemented. The first is a Bag-of-Words based system, and the second is a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. The Caltech4 data set is used for training. The VLFeat library is used to extract features for the BoW model, and the LIBLINEAR library for setting up the classifier.  

Final project for the UvA course Computer Vision 1 (Spring 2017). See [report](report.pdf).
